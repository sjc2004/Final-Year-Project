        "\n",
        "<b>\"Key distribution\"</b> is a type of secure communication protocol which is accomplished with the use of a <b>\"key\"</b> (which is just a bitstring with a sequence of 0s and 1s) that is uniquely known only by the sender (let's call them \"Alice\") and receiver (let's call them \"Bob\"), and enables them to encrypt and decrypt a sent message. If a key can be securely distributed between Alice and Bob, the encrypted message can be securely sent over a public channel. Without this key, it is difficult to sucessfully decrypt this message by an eavesdropper. Thus, a secure communication relies on the ability of Alice to encrypt the message in a way that only Bob can decrypt it.\n",
        "\n",
        "<b>\"Quantum key distribution\"</b> or <b>\"QKD\"</b> is unique compared to classical key distribution schemes because it makes use of an important aspect of quantum mechanics where any measurement performed on a quantum system (by any third party, in this case an eavesdropper) disturbs it, thus detecting eavesdropping attempts and securing the message.\n",
